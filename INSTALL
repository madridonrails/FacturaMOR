Ruby
----
This application was developed with Ruby 1.8.4 and Ruby 1.8.5.

Before compiling Ruby from sources be sure that the zlib dev files are installed,
you can test whether zlib support is compiled running

  ruby -rzlib -e1

If you get a silent prompt back it is installed, otherwise you see an error.

The readline library should be available as well, otherwise script/console won't work.

Rails comes bundled
-------------------
Rails 1.2.2 comes bundled under vendor, no need to install it separately.
Don't worry if there's a system-wide Rails, if so it is ignored.

Rubygems
--------

Some dependencies are installed using the gem library manager:

  wget http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/11289/rubygems-0.9.0.tgz
  tar xzf rubygems-0.9.0.tgz
  cd rubygems-0.9.0
  sudo ruby setup.rb

ImageMagick
-----------
No known version requirement.


Gems
----
mini_magick (1.2.0)
fastercsv (1.2.0)
rexml-expansion-fix


mod_xsendfile (for production mode)
-----------------------------------
http://tn123.ath.cx/mod_xsendfile/


MySQL
-----
Stable version of MySQL 5.

It is very important to set UTF-8 as charset of the database explicitly,
like this:

  drop database if exists gastosmini;
  create database gastosmini character set utf8;
  grant all on gastosmini.* to 'username'@'localhost' identified by 'password';

or the equivalent if you use a wizard.

The database is created with a task, see rake -T

Once the very database has been created, you need to create (or update) the
schema running

  rake db:migrate

from the application root directory. If you need to update the production schema set RAILS_ENV to 'production' before. For instance in sh-like shells:

  export RAILS_ENV=production && rake db:migrate
  

Configuration files
-------------------
You need to create

  config/facturagem.yml
  config/database.yml
  config/mailer.rb
  config/local_config.rb (configuration of exception_notifier,google_analytics and others constants)

taking their corresponding .example as a starting point.


exception_notification (http://www.agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/exception_notifier)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Exception Notifier plugin provides a mailer object and a default set of
templates for sending email notifications when errors occur in a Rails
application. The plugin is configurable, allowing programmers to specify:

* the sender address of the email
* the recipient addresses
* the text used to prefix the subject line

google_analytics
----------------
Google Analytics is a free service offered by Google that generates 
detailed statistics about the visitors to a website

LaTeX
-----
We need pdflatex in path (install tetex-bin, tetex-extra, latex-ucs, latex-xcolor, cm-super in debians, 
or MiKTeX on Windows). The package cm-super makes fonts in PDFs look prettier, but it is necessary to have 
a working instance for development.
